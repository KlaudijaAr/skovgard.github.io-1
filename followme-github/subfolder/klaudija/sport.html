                            <h6>Story of the F1 season</h6>
                        </div>
                        <p>Lewis Hamilton sits on the brink of a fifth Formula One world title, a milestone previously reached by only two other drivers in the sport's history. 
With no other driver on the grid seemingly able to match the Brit's relentless excellence -- teammate Valtteri Bottas recently told CNN's The Circuit that Hamilton is the "perfect reference in F1" -- or any other manufacturer able to match Mercedes' reliability, people are beginning to ask: How many?
 
Can Hamilton surpass the five titles won by Juan Manuel Fangio, the legendary Argentine who tore up the track in the 1950s?

Can he match Michael Schumacher's all-time record of seven world championships, a total that, until recently, seemed untouchable?
                   It's a question that would have been scoffed at less than two years ago but, with Hamilton on the cusp of winning his fourth title in five seasons, is now arguably looking more likely to happen than not.
                   "With the trajectory he is on, I don't see why he wouldn't stay and beat that target because not many people in our lifetime are ever going to get the chance to go for it," Lawrence Barretto, senior writer for Formula1.com, tells CNN.
"Lewis (is) clearly as hungry as ever to win and I find it difficult to see how he can't be a contender for at least the next few years -- and when he's a contender it's very difficult to look beyond him as the champion.
"If he can have a shot at beating Michael Schumacher's titles, a record that -- when he got that seventh title -- I didn't think would ever get beaten and here we are, not even 15 years later, talking about it." 
Hamilton already has 80 pole positions compared to Schumacher's 68 and is just 20 race wins behind the German legend's all-time record of 91.
Given the he has averaged 10 wins per season over the last five years, it certainly looks to be another attainable target.</p>

                        <p>With Hamilton leading championship rival Sebastian Vettel by 30 points heading into September's Singapore Grand Prix, the 33-year-old was heavily criticized for his preparation in the build up.
In the days leading up to the race weekend, Hamilton clocked up a staggering 25,000 air miles, flying to Shanghai and New York for the launch of his debut fashion collaboration with Tommy Hilfiger.
Many thought the hectic schedule, lack of rest and, in particular, the jet lag would negatively impact his performance on the track but Hamilton proved the doubters wrong -- and in some style.
"I know there were questions at the start of the week as to whether these things outside of Formula One are a distraction to me," Hamilton said immediately after his victory.
"I came here, and I thought: 'Jeez, if I put one foot wrong, people are going to point to the things I do as a result of it.' "But you can see that it doesn't affect my performance and, if anything, those things add to the performance. I get a lot of energy from these different things that I do.
"I find it stimulating and I think you'll see that my results have shown that for the past several years."
Barretto says Mercedes' strength comes from their ability to sustain title challenges even when they have the inferior car, as has been the case for much of 2018, but much of this is down to Hamilton's ability to "turn it on" when it really counts.
In Singapore, on a track where Vettel's Ferrari was expected to be strong and dominate, Hamilton put in a scintillating lap in Q3 to snatch an unexpected 79th career pole that left both his team and rivals in shock.
It was arguably one of the greatest laps of Hamilton's career and set him up for a flawless race in Sunday's grand prix.
Few drivers in history have possessed Hamilton's ability to drive to his maximum potential and eek every millisecond out of a track when it really counts, something that inspires his teammate Bottas.
"Lewis being Lewis, a quick driver, he keeps me very motivated," the Finn told CNN's The Circuit last month. "I want to be ahead of him. Me as a driver, you can always learn from another driver, it would be silly not to try. 
"I can always learn more. I'm in a car that can win races and I'm next to Lewis, who is the perfect reference in F1 because if I will be able to beat him then: 'Okay, Valtteri can drive', and I know it as well.
"Being alongside Lewis with the new team around, there's a great opportunity to learn much, much more." </p>
