                        <p>Kelly Thomas inches across the soft grass, using a walker to navigate her way. Each step is exhilarating and exhausting. She pauses amid the 90-degree Florida heat and smiles. 
"It only takes a little bit of try -- and by a little, I mean a lot," she says.
Thomas, 24, is one of three paralyzed patients who can now walk again, thanks to a stimulation device implanted in her lower back coupled with intense physical therapy. News of the patients' progress -- considered an important medical advancement -- was published in separate studies in two scientific journals on Monday. 

On a recent sunny day, Thomas returned to the spot that took so much from her on July 19, 2014. It's where the truck she was driving came to a halt after flipping four times around a bend on Halls River Road and smashing into a tree. Her body was motionless, hanging halfway out of the mangled wreckage. She was blue and getting cold.
She has driven past the scene of the crash many times since then to try to jar her memory. To help remember what happened that night. To piece together the moment that changed everything. Nothing seems to work. Visiting this time, she walks toward the tree, talking to her legs to motivate them to keep moving. "One foot in front of the other," she says. "Slowly but surely."
At 5 feet, 1 inch tall, she is a spitfire of inspiration. Her grit shows immediately, not just from when she walks, but also when she talks. 
"Paralysis isn't in my dictionary." 
"Don't call me handicapped, because I'm not."
"Thank God, I was raised cowboy tough."
It takes several minutes for her to walk the 40 feet from her car to the tree. Every step is worth it: Today is about triumph rather than a search for lost memories. 
"I tell you what," she says. "It does feel good to be standing where I thought my life ended."
She woke in a hospital a couple of weeks after the accident, with tubes and wires seemingly hooked up to everything. At 19, she was paralyzed from the chest down.She told her neurosurgeon she would walk again, no matter how slim the odds. He left the room and told her mother not to "go chasing something that's never going to happen."
The journey has been in no way easy. 
There were tears and screaming fits. In moments of desperation, she would say to God, "I don't know why this has happened, but if you can help me to understand this, it might make it a little easier." 
She had planned to become a physical therapist to help others. Her mission changed that fateful July day. She's now helping others by taking steps and speaking up. 
The trunk of the red maple still bears scars from the crash, with chunks of bark missing from when truck and tree met. 
As she stands next to the tree, Thomas searches for the words to describe her emotions. "It's somewhere between 'I told you so' and the impossible," she says. "Somewhere between possible and impossible.
"Being here gives me a sense of power, because I lost a life here. But I also gained a brand new one. And I'm proud of the new life I have."</p>
